# ToDo-List-Application

A simple to do list application.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Ensure that you are able to download the dependencies either with yarn or npm. I used npm. 
https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/

## Downloading

### Installing dependencies 
On the command line, run the following command to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.
```
npm i       
```
Ensure that you have all of the dependencies, as shown below in the package. json file.




#### Running
On the command line, run the following command which will host our React app on a local server. 
```
npm start
```

This runs an arbitrary command specified in the package's "start" property of its "scripts" object. If no "start" property is specified on the "scripts" object, it will run node server. js .
